# Exploring Modern Intrusion Detection Systems based on Machine Learning and their implementation on SDN and IoT Networks: A Literature Survey

## Abstract
In todayâ€™s world, the growing popularity of the Internet
and increasing connectivity of end devices, has resulted in
a sudden rise in the number of cyber threats and attacks. As the
popularity increases, the complexity of attacks rises. Intrusion Detection
System (IDS) is a security-related method that helps protect
systems or networks against such attacks by regularly monitoring
the network for suspicious traffic and raise alerts when needed.
However, traditional IDS face issues to identify new attacks, which
can go undetected.
Hence, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been used as a
solution to the above-mentioned issue. This survey aims to discuss
how ML has improved conventional IDS and assess the effectiveness
and functionalities of some of the ML-IDS models built for SDN
and IoT networks.
The structure of the paper is as follows: Section I gives a brief
overview on IDS, ML, IoT, and SDN. Section II investigates some
of the existing ML-IDS models designed for IoT and SDN architectures.
Section III discusses the benefits, disadvantages, and some
suggestions for system improvement.
